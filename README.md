Advent of code is an annual Christmas-themed coding challenge that poses problems to be solved with code. An original two-part challenge is released each day starting December 1st.

I am still learning the Odin programming language, I am by no means an expert.

I am not doing this to be competitive so I will likely fall behind as I work full time during the week. I will do what I can to catch up and go as far as I am able

Status: <br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1">Day 1</a> parts A and B complete. Learned basic file reading in Odin<br>
Day 2 complete and correct. More parsing, made some helper procedures for easier to read code<br>
Day 3 complete and correct. Many helper procedures made and working together.<br>
Day 4 complete and correct. Worked all week so I will be catching up on the challenges. Added notes as the problems are becoming more complicated (as expected)<br>
