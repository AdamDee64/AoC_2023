Advent of code is an annual Christmas-themed coding challenge that poses problems to be solved with code. An original two-part challenge is released each day starting December 1st.

I am still learning the Odin programming language, I am by no means an expert.

I am not doing this to be competitive so I will likely fall behind as I work full time during the week. I will do what I can to catch up and go as far as I am able
