Advent of code is an annual Christmas-themed coding challenge that poses problems to be solved with code. An original two-part challenge is released each day starting December 1st.

I am still learning the Odin programming language, I am by no means an expert.

I am not doing this to be competitive so I will likely fall behind as I work full time during the week. I will do what I can to catch up and go as far as I am able

Status: <br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1">Day 1</a> parts A and B complete. Learned basic file reading in Odin<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2">Day 2</a> complete and correct. More parsing, made some helper procedures for easier to read code<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3">Day 3</a> complete and correct. Many helper procedures made and working together.<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4">Day 4</a> complete and correct. Worked all week so I will be catching up on the challenges. Added notes as the problems are becoming more complicated (as expected)<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5">Day 5</a> part 1 complete, got some practice using odin's dynamic arrays<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6">Day 6</a> Both parts complete, easy compared to day 5<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7">Day 7</a> I spent a lot of time on this one implementing multiple sorts in order to score the cards correctly. After part A was correct, part B was rather simple. The timing took a real hit due to the multiple sorting, roughly 40 milliseconds total run time for each part. Most of the previous challenge solutions are in the sub-millisecond range on my machine. The sorting algorithm is a basic bubble sort though and could be improved upon.<br>
