Advent of Code 2023 done in the Odin programming language

Advent of code is an annual Christmas-themed coding challenge that poses problems to be solved with code. An original two-part challenge is released each day starting December 1st.

I am still learning the Odin programming language, I am by no means an expert.

I am not doing this to be competitive so I will likely fall behind as I work full time during the week. I will do what I can to catch up and go as far as I am able

Status: <br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1">Day 1</a> parts A and B complete. Learned basic file reading in Odin<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2">Day 2</a> complete and correct. More parsing, made some helper procedures for easier to read code<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3">Day 3</a> complete and correct. Many helper procedures made and working together.<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4">Day 4</a> complete and correct. Worked all week so I will be catching up on the challenges. Added notes as the problems are becoming more complicated (as expected)<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5">Day 5</a> part 1 complete, got some practice using odin's dynamic arrays<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6">Day 6</a> Both parts complete, easy compared to day 5<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7">Day 7</a> I spent a lot of time on this one implementing multiple sorts in order to score the cards correctly. After part A was correct, part B was rather simple. The timing took a real hit due to the multiple sorting, roughly 40 milliseconds total run time for each part. Most of the previous challenge solutions are in the sub-millisecond range on my machine. The sorting algorithm is a basic bubble sort though and could be improved upon.<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8">Day 8</a> Could only complete part 1, for part 2 I am able to make the test input work, but not the actual input, it just gets stuck in an endless loop. I spent hours on this before giving up<br>
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15">Day 15</a> I skipped multiple days to catch up to the current challenges. Again I spent hours on part 2, but it turns out I had the solution early on, I just didn't realize that Odin doesn't do depe copys of strings by default, so when I was comparing strings, I was really comparing the pointers to the same allocated space and getting a positive every time, ruining the outcome of the challenge. Once I realized this, it was a simple copy and I got the correct answer on my first try. <br>

With that I think I've gotten as far as I can go with advent of code 2023, It's been some interesting challenges and I have learned a few things about working with this programming language<br>
